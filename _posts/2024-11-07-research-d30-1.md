## Problems


### 1. Excess of virtual elements on Server ITM2.

- The current network element distribution across the hard-servers is leading to a "Server Resource Overload".

- Elasticsearch Server and Fleet Server are in the same hard-server as the Windows Server and the Linux Server. Limited resource allocation on Elasticsearch Server deeply constrains Elasticsearch server's performance causing data-stream collection loss.

#### Solution: Migration of Elasticsearch server to ITM4

- To easy the setup test case, we migrate the Elasticsearch server to ITM4 and reconfigure Fleet Server point the the new Elasticsearch server's IP address.

- We also deploy new Elasticsearch agents across all the virtual network elements.
