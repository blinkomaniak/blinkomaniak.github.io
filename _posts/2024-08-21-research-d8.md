# A VM, VirtualBox, and the Host. A networking story.

Again, remember that we want to build this topology for server 1?

And, remember we were concentrating on how to setup the opnsense router networking configuration?

And, that we were not able to configure it properly due to the following yet-unanswered questions?

- what network configuration (nat, bridge, host-only network) should I use for the WAN interface of the opnsense router? (The WAN interface is the one connecting to the `eno` interface of the host).
- And if we know the network configuration type, are we 100% certain sure about the inherent opnsense router configuration (meaning `firewall > rules | nat | other configs`)?


# A little of though-process

- what would be the best strategy to configure and test this task? 

- Well, I can start iterating between network configuration modes for the WAN interface and, for each option, I could test different configurations in the opnsense firewall ...

- But this is is too uncertain. We need some certainty.

# Solution, or kind of ...

- Let's build another vm (this time an ubuntu server vm) and test the networking and try to achieve internet access (pings to `8.8.8.8`). Sounds like some randome plan but ... whatever, inaction is the worst action. 

- We are not going to put the steps on how to build this vm because it is a trivial procedure easily acknowledgeable with any online tutorial. 

# Let's use an Ubuntu VM to test connectivity!

- So, let's take a look at the networking configuration of this setup.

- Ok, so in the picture we see that the Ubuntu VM has a DHCP-provided IP address from the NAT mode. 

- And, if you take a closed look in the previous picture, the terminal propmpt manifests that this VM is able to send pings through the host and through the router. **Which means that, highly likely, there are no rules or any other kind of restriction of ICMP packets.**

# Pings from the VM to Internet work!

- And, here it is. The ubuntu server vm that we just build and, good news!!!! It is able to ping to `8.8.8.8`.

![alt text](assets/images/linuxserver-ping.png)

- So, the following would be the logic of it:

![alt text](assets/images/ubuntu-server-networking-pings.png)

- The packets are leaving the Ubuntu VM. They go through the virtualbox networking in the host. They also go through the host networking (interface `eno1`) and, finally, they get to the server in the internet.

- Then, the packets are replied by the external server in the internet and all those packets are able to reach back the Ubuntu VM.

# So, now that we now that a simple VM can reach the internet, let's try with the opnsense router ... 

- Ok, now let's try with the opnsense router in the same network configuration (`nat`).

- Here is the network topology:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-network-topology.png)

- As you can see, it is the same as the Ubuntu VM, even they are assigned the same ip address `10.0.2.15/24` from different nat networks.

- We launch pings from the opnsense terminal:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-pingfail.png)

- We can see that the pings are 100% packet loss

- But ... in the host `eno1` interface ...

![alt text](assets/images/tcpdump-pings.png)

- ... the tcpdump is detecting ICMP packets.

- If we carefully inspect one of the bidirectional packets:

![alt text](assets/images/tcpdump-bidirectionalpackets.png)

- We see that these two packets are in the same sequence of packets (`seq=15`). The first packet is the `ICMP echo request` from our host ip (`117.17.189.202`) towards `dns.google`. And the second packet is the `ICMP echo reply` from google to our host.

# So, pings goes out but do not reach back the opn router

- Therefore, we can conclude that this is what is happening:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-fail-pings.png)

- The ICMP packet requests are leaving the opnsense router
- ICMP packet requests goes through virtualbox and host networking
- ICMP packet requests reach google `8.8.8.8`
- The ICMP packet replies reach the host at `eno1` interface.
- However, for some reason to investigate, the replies do not reach the OPNsense router.

- Then, let's think over the three possible points of inspection:

- **the host networking**: well, to be honest, it did worked with the Ubuntu VM. Therefore, I don't see problem with `iptables` and the host does have enabled the firewal `ufw`.

- **the virtualbox networking**: the same argument. it did worked with the Ubuntu VM.

- **the opnsense configuration for incoming icmp packets**: well, here we have something to investigate!

# Narrow the faulty segment ... 

- So, we need to narrow the network segment that is causing the problem.

- Remember, the problem is that our opnsense router can not send ICMP packets to the internet. Or at least, it sends the icmp packets but there is apparently some missing configuration in the firewall service of the opnsense router that does not allow the icmp packet reply to reach back the opnsense router.

- Therefore, I'm thinking about checking the icmp packets over these two network points. 

- The first point is the virtualbox NAT system. The question we need to answer is: **is the NAT doing both translations (source nat and destination nat) properly?**

- The second test point is the host network interface `eno1`. The question we need to answer is: **are the icmp request and reply going through this interface?**

- Therefore, we need to implement the tests as it is shown in the picture below:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-tests.png)

- In this sense, the tests will allow us to visualize the following segment demarcation.

- With this segment demarcation, we will be able to check if an ICMP packet reaches any of this stages.

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-trouble-segmentation.png)

# Time for testing ... 

- Let's just try to send an ICMP packet and check out what the other two prompts show.

- The result on the terminal tracking the NAT connections is:

#### In the host: `sudo conntrack -E -p icmp`

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-conntrack.png)

- If we take a close look on the terminal of the command `sudo conntrack -E -p icmp`:

```bash
    [NEW] icmp     1 30 src=117.17.189.202 dst=8.8.8.8 type=8 code=0 id=13076 [UNREPLIED] src=8.8.8.8 dst=117.17.189.202 type=0 code=0 id=13076
 [UPDATE] icmp     1 30 src=117.17.189.202 dst=8.8.8.8 type=8 code=0 id=13076 src=8.8.8.8 dst=117.17.189.202 type=0 code=0 id=13076
```

- ChatGPT says:

```
- [NEW]: A new ICMP Echo Request (type=8, ping) was sent from your hostâ€™s public IP 117.17.189.202 to Google's DNS server 8.8.8.8. The request is awaiting a reply ([UNREPLIED]).

- [UPDATE]: The ICMP Echo Reply (type=0) from 8.8.8.8 to your host's public IP 117.17.189.202 was received, completing the ping process. The connection tracking entry was updated to reflect this.
```

- Therefore, this means that the NAT translation is requested two times to perform a network translation. One time is for the ICMP request packet is traveling from the opnsense router WAN interface towards the host network interface and the other time is for when the ICMP reply packet is traveling viceversa, from the host networking towards the opnsense router WAN interface.

- Now, let's take a look in the host's network interface `eno1` with `tcpdump`:

#### In the host `sudo tcpdump -i eno1 icmp -vvvv`

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-tcpdump.png)

- We can see that the ICMP request packet is already ip-address translated. Because, you can see that it says `117.17.189.202 > dns.google ...`. So the source ip address now is the host ip address.

- We can also see that there is a ICMP reply packet that is reaching the `eno1` from the internet. As we saw on the previous picture with the command `sudo conntrack -E -p icmp`, this ICMP reply reaches the `NAT system` in the virtualbox networking.

#### In the OPNsense router `ping 8.8.8.8`

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-ping.png)

- The above picture shows how pings from the opnsense router are 100% packet loss, for whatever reason it is.

# **Conlusion: Problem is in the segment of the opnsense router, specifically related to the incoming packets at WAN interface**

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-problem-segment.png)


- Given that the ICMP request is able to reach the google server, this means that the packets are capable of leaving the opnsense router, which means that outbound traffic is working.

- Now, as follow the tracking of the ICMP reply packets, and we saw the last positive checkpoint was the NAT translation system in virtualbox and host.

- Therefore, we have to inspect again the opnsense configuration dashboard looking specifically in some rules in the firewall or some restrictions for WAN interface.

- So, in the firewall rules of the opnsense router, there is the following for `Firewall > Rules > WAN`:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-firewall-rules-wan.png)

- The above picture shows that there are two rules in the Firewall configuration for the WAN interface. In short, these rules allow bidirectional any-traffic for IPv4 protocol.
