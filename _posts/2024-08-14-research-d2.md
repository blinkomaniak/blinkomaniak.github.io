# We can connect through Remote Desktop to the Ubuntu Server

So, as you can see down below, we managed to get remote access through xrdp protocol to the ubuntu server.

_Remote Desktop connection through Remmina application_

I have to be honest. I don't know what I did wrong when configuring xrdp! I guess it's one of those times, uh?!

# So, let's implement OPNSense router in the remote server

Anyways, moving through, shall we configure our OPNSense router?

So, remember that we needed to configure a router? Here, take a look on the below figure, can you spot the three routers we need:

![alt text](assets/images/proposednetwork.png)

No? How about now?

![alt text](assets/images/proposednetwork-routers.png)

and, as you can see, we need to create dedicated tunnels between them.

But one step at a time! 

Let's start with the deployment of the first OPNSense Router in server 1.

The first idea that comes to my mind is to check the OPNSense documentation, maybe youtube tutorials, chatgpt, etc.

But, stop, we are engineers! we are methodic! 

I am capable of figuring this problem out!

**First, this installation is virtual, so we need to know what `computational resources` do we need for this router. Then, we need to find some sort of `initial configuration`. Then, we move into `advanced configuration`.**

# Found some computational requirements for the OPNsense VM

This link [Hardware Sizing & Setup](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/hardware.html) contains the minimum requirements to install a virtual local machine of OPNSense. The picture also depicts it:

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-requirements.png)

This link [Installation](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html) contains the related to the installation process **but I don't find it that much useful since it does not contain a guide on virtualbox**.

We quickly check this opnsense documentation ([link](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html))

So, on the ladder link, opnsense documentation says we need to setup our virtual machine with the following minimum requirements:

- RAM: 4096 MB
- Processor: 1
- Storage: 50 GB
- Network: **It does not mention it**

# But, in the documentation we didn't found specs or suggestions for the network adapters of OPNsense router 
[Little trouble here]
Wait, what???

The official documentation doesn't mention anything about network interfaces in a virtual local installation? 

You can check it out here [link](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/virtuals.html#local-server). And, it is a little bit surprising because it leads you to think ... I mean, we are implementing a router, right? Routers connect two or more networks. Therefore, when configuring a virtual router, we design how many networks we will directly connect. But, the documentation does not mention or suggests any network-interface configuration. And, this is not a simple issue because, in virtualbox, you can choose a network interface to be _nat, bridge, only-host_ type, etc. So, it's not so simple as _just pick 2, and be this and that_.
[End of Little trouble]

# Then, we decide to check some video tutorials

How about if we go straight to a youtube video.

So, this is the video for reference that I will use to configure the interfaces of the vm: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE5xzb-qJgA)

Minute 1:22 suggests to go, in VirtualBox, to `Tools > Network > Host-only Networks > Create > vboxnet0` (it will create its own ip range)

Minute 1:34 suggests to setup two network adapters in the VM. Adapter 1 to be setup as _Bridge Network_ (pointing to the actual ethernet interface of the server) and Adapter 2 to be setup as _Host-Only Adapter_, selecting the _vboxnet0_ network that we just created.

The author takes note of both mac addresses as a future reference for acknowledging which interface to configure at OPNsense dashboard.

# Now, let's try to really create the OPNsense router

### Let's connect to our remote server and create the vm:

This are Remmina config to access it (of course, I won't reveal sensible data):
![alt text](assets/images/xrdp-credentials.png)

We connect and ... 

Here we have a remote desktop connection to our remote server:

![alt text](assets/images/rs.png)

# Little note here:

### Problem with XRDP and remote multiple sessions:

Now, for some reason, every time that I logout from my user session in the Remmina -remote-desktop- connection, the server does not accept my user password when trying to log-in again.

I spent so much time trying to solve that issue but I coulnd't. I will put some references here to quote what am I talking about:

# ... we hit start ... and, we found some problems

There is an error when starting this vm:

![alt text](assets/images/problems-vm.png)

_VirtualBox - Guru Meditation_

_A critical error has occurred while running the virtual machine and the machine execution has been stopped._

The message suggests us to inspect the file `VBox.log` and that's what we do:

```bash
oscar@itm2:~$ cat VirtualBox\ VMs/OPNSense1/Logs/VBox.log | grep ERROR
00:00:00.938704 ERROR [COM]: aRC=NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG (0x80070057) aIID={4680b2de-8690-11e9-b83d-5719e53cf1de} aComponent={DisplayWrap} aText={Argument aWidth is invalid (must be aWidth != 0 && aWidth <= 32767)}, preserve=false aResultDetail=0
```

# Also, there is another warning pop up, and, I don't know if it's related to the same issue that is causing the vm not to work:

![alt text](assets/images/vbox-warning.png)

We tried disabling the audio on the vm but apparently, it didn't solve the _critical error_ problem.

We inspect again the `VBox.log` file:

```bash
oscar@itm2:~$ cat VirtualBox\ VMs/OPNSense1/Logs/VBox.log | grep ERROR
00:00:00.902734 [/Devices/mc146818/ERROR [COM]: aRC=NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG (0x80070057) aIID={4680b2de-8690-11e9-b83d-5719e53cf1de} aComponent={DisplayWrap} aText={Argument aWidth is invalid (must be aWidth != 0 && aWidth <= 32767)}, preserve=false aResultDetail=0
00:00:54.393083 ERROR [COM]: aRC=NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG (0x80070057) aIID={4680b2de-8690-11e9-b83d-5719e53cf1de} aComponent={DisplayWrap} aText={Argument aWidth is invalid (must be aWidth != 0 && aWidth <= 32767)}, preserve=false aResultDetail=0
```

I decided to perform a google search of the error:

![alt text](assets/images/vboxlog-error.png)

and on the second result is a forum, and click there ([link](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=424497)) and the first message contains the same error I am getting in `VBox.log`:

![alt text](assets/images/forum-error.png)

so, apparently the solution everyone converges is to upgrade the virtualbox to 7.0 version.

I follow the steps from the virtualbox official documentation to install virtualbox 7.0 [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

and it worked!!!

Now, you can see that virtualbox is loading the OPNsense router dashboard in the remote server.

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-dashboard.png)

# Now, that we can setup the OPNSense router, next task is to actually set it up ...

So, the credentials to access 

- root:opnsense (Live mode)
- installer:opnsense (Installer mode)

As we are in the installer role at the moment, let's opt for the second one.

Then, we are shown up the following features to configure:

#### Keymap selection
![alt text](assets/images/opn-config1-keymap-selection.png)

#### Choose UFS

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-installer-ufs.png)

#### UFS Configuration

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-installer-ufs-config.png)

choose the hard disk, not the cd room

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-config-swap.png)

it is going to ask us confirmation:

![alt text](assets/images/image.png)

just press `Yes`

![alt text](assets/images/image-1.png)

![alt text](assets/images/image-2.png)

![alt text](assets/images/image-3.png)

installation complete

![alt text](assets/images/image-4.png)

We choose **Complete Install - Exit and reboot**

Once OPNsense rebooted:

![alt text](assets/images/image-5.png)

We shutdown the vm.

We remove the DVD installer from the CD-ROOM device of the vm.

Then, we initialize the vm again:

and, it's telling me that:

- The LAN interface has the ip address of `192.168.1.1/24` 
- The WAN interface has the ip address of `192.168.56.101/24`


![alt text](assets/images/image-6.png)

We opt for option 1

we answer `n` to the two next questions

and we get:

![alt text](assets/images/image-7.png)

and, remember we configured our vm as follows:

![alt text](assets/images/opnrouter1-network1.png)
![alt text](assets/images/opnrouter1-network2.png)

Then, we have that

| Network Interface | OPN Interface | MAC Address | VBox | 
|----------|----------|----------|----------| 
| LAN | em0 | 08:00:27:ab:d2:c9 | bridge |
| WAN | em1 | 08:00:27:5a:6d:d4 | vboxnet0 |

# And this table is wrong!

why? 

because, the WAN interface is the one in bridge mode with the physical interface of the host, whilst the LAN interface is the one which should be set up in host-only network type given that will support an internal network.

# The correct assigment should be as follows

| Network Interface | OPN Interface | MAC Address | VBox | 
|----------|----------|----------|----------| 
| WAN | em0 | 08:00:27:ab:d2:c9 | bridge |
| LAN | em1 | 08:00:27:5a:6d:d4 | vboxnet0 |

So as we do:

![alt text](assets/images/opnssense-interface-assign.png)

# Once the interfaces are well assigned, we proceed with setting the interface IP Address

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-ipconfig.png)

LAN will be the first interface to be configured:

We disable LAN interface to obtain its ip address through DHCP protocol

We setup LAN ipv4 address as `192.168.56.2` according to the `vboxnet0` ip range that we previously saw.

And we configure the subnet mask to be `24`

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-config-lan.png)

# We managed to configure the OPNSense interfaces ... and enabled the GUI interface service ... 

Then, we:

Reject configuring IPv6 in the LAN interface

Reject configuring IPv6 in the LAN interface via DHCP

We don't provide any IPv6 LAN address

We enabled the DHCP server on LAN 

We specified the range from: 192.168.56.10 - 100

We reject changing the web GUI protocol from HTTPS to HTTP

And, we request to generate a new self-signed web GUI certificate

Finally, we restore web GUI access to defaults

![alt text](assets/images/opnsense-config-final.png)

# Now, we want to access OPNSense configurations through the GUI Interface

So, basically, after that set of config questions, we are prompted a message telling us that we can access the web GUI interface at `http://192.168.56.2`

# But, of course, ... another stupid error ... this time is the web-browser in the host with some error ... 

But, when trying to open a web-browser in the ubuntu host, we got a message of, apparently, firefox complaining about an error. 

I didn't take a picture of the Firefox GUI error.

But, I did have a error log that showed when I tried to execute `firefox` from the terminal

```
oscar@itm2:~$ firefox

Error: no DISPLAY environment variable specified
```

So, before putting our selves into researching the issue, I opted for rebooting the server.

Let's wait some seconds ... 


Once the VM rebooted, we tried to initialized `firefox`, the promp continued showing `no DISPLAY environment variable specified`

Syslog did not show anything

```bash
oscar@itm2:~$ sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
[sudo] password for oscar:

Sep 15 11:30:14 itm2 dbus-daemon[1391]: [system] Reloaded configuration
```

`dmesg` maybe has some clues:

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i firefox
[  635.293572] audit: type=1400 audit(1723680532.024:85): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" profile="snap-update-ns.firefox" name="/usr/local/share/" pid=4011 comm="5" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=0 ouid=0
```

So, we try from the terminal through the remote desktop connection, and found this error:

![alt text](assets/images/firefox-error-terminal.png)

We googled the issue

![alt text](assets/images/google-error.png)

The first search result is a forum, in which there is a message that was worth the try

![alt text](assets/images/firefox-possible-solution.png)

we applied it but still there is an error:

![alt text](assets/images/solution-test.png)

So we tried by uninstalling and re-installing `firefox`

![alt text](assets/images/chatgpt-suggestion.png)

and no, still unable to make `firefox` run

# Time for a small decision

At this point, we have two paths

1. Continue trying to solve the issue (haven't we learned a lot yet)

2. Find ways to download and install through terminal other web-browsers

# I choosed to continue with option 1

So, apparently there is this problem in which **snap applications don't run through VNC sessions**, and, why not, probably **any remote desktop connection**

![alt text](assets/images/result2.png)

we are going to try solution described in [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1399383/how-to-install-firefox-as-a-traditional-deb-package-without-snap-in-ubuntu-22/1404401#1404401)

So, we uninstalled all current versions of firefox (from apt, from snap)

And, proceed to install `firefox-esr`

It worked!

![alt text](assets/images/firefoxaccess.png)

We logged in with `root/opnsense` credentials

That's all for today

# So, Basically today we manage to get web access to the opnsense router
