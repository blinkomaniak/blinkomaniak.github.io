# Configuring opnsense networking as "host-only"

Let's recap

We want to implement the following topology:

**Why?**

Given the computational capabilities that are required to run several virtual machines, to construct our mini-network, **we have to split our network in several hosts**. The proposed distribution needs routers/firewalls to behave as a typical enterprise network. Routers will enable the capability to create dedicated tunnels between hosts. And, in this way, we will be able to communicate the internal networks, which behave as different network segments of the enterprise network network.
