# Configuring opnsense networking as "host-only"

Let's recap

We want to implement the following topology:

**Why?**

Given the computational capabilities that are required to run several virtual machines, to construct our mini-network, **we have to split our virtual network in several hosts**. The proposed distribution needs routers/firewalls to behave as a typical enterprise network. Routers will enable the capability to create dedicated tunnels between hosts. And, in this way, we will be able to communicate the internal networks, which behave as different network segments of the enterprise network.

**How to proceed?**

Then, currently, the issue is in getting to communicate 02 of the virtual routers, from different physical servers, between each other with out any problem.

If we managed to communicate the OPNsense routers from both of the physical servers with a private VPN, then, we can connect the internal networks behind both routers.
