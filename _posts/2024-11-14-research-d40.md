## Problem 

![alt text](/assets/images2/homework04.png)

## Understanding the problem

`ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=cyl, y=hwy)) + geom_point()`

This code creates a **scatterplot** of highway mileage (`hwy`) versus the number of cylinders (`cyl`) using the `mpg` dataset. Each point represents a car model. However, the resultl ikely does not align with the information we aim to convey due to limitations with categorical x-axis data, as we will explore.

## Three-Step Framework Analysis

**1. Define the Data and Mapping**: In this case, the x-axis (`cyl`) is mapped to the number of cylinders (a categorical variable), and the y-axis (`hwy`) is mapped to highway mileage. This setup shows a vertical stack of points aat each unique cylinder value (e.g., 4, 6, 8 cylinders).

**2. Choose a Geometric Object**: The code uses `geom_point()` to create a scatterplot. Each point represents a single car mode;'s mileage against its cylinder count.

**3. Refine with Additional Layers and Aesthetics**: There are no additional layers or adjustments here to enhance interpretability.

## Critiquing the Visualization

- The **x-axis variable**, `cyl`, **is categorical**, which leads to vertical stacking of points rather than showing a trend distribution. How the fact that `cyl` is categorical is related with leading a vertical stacking of points rather than a trend distribution?

- There is **no indication of density** within each cylinder category, which means the plot does not effectively convey differences in mileage distribution for each cylinder group.

- **Overlapping points** make it difficult to see the density or spread of data points clearly, a problem known as ``overplotting''.

## A Better Alternative Visualization

To better communicate the data, a **boxplot** would be more effective for categorical data like `cyl`. A boxplot will show the distribution, median, and range of highway mileage for each cylinder category, making it easier to compare these values.

### Ideal Visualization Code

Here is how to make this improved boxplot:

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Highway Mileage (mpg)", title = "Highway Mileage by Cylinder Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Explanation

- `geom_boxplot()`: This layer plots the boxplot, displaying the distribution of highway mileage within each cylinder category.
- `geom_jitter()`: This adds a slight horizontal ``jitter'' to each point, spreading them out within each cylinder category. Jittering helps visualize points density without overlap.
- `labs()`: Adds descriptive axis labels and a title.
- `theme_minimal()`: This theme makes the plot cleaner and less cluttered.

## Another suggestion for visualization

### 1. Faceted Scatterplot

Faceting creates multiple subplots for each cylinder category (`cyl`). This allows each category to have its own plot, reducing vertical stacking and making it easier to observe the distribution of `hwy` values within each cylinder group.

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl) +
  labs(x = "Highway Mileage (mpg)", y = "Engine Displacement (liters)", title = "Highway Mileage by Cylinder Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Explanation

- `facet_wrap(~ cyl)`: creates separate scatterplots for each unique `cyl` value.
- This approach gives each cylinder group its own space, helping to avoid overplotting and making it easier to interpret differences in `hwy` values.

### 2. Jittered Scatterplot with Transparency

Adding jitter and adjusting transparency directly addresses the issue of vertical stacking and overlapping points, while still using a scatterplot. This technique was mentioned in Chapter 1 for handling overplotting issues.

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Number of Cylinders", y = "Highway Mileage (mpg)", title = "Highway Mileage by Cylinder Count with Jitter") +
  theme_minimal()
```

![alt text](/assets/images2/jittered-scatterplot.png)

#### Explanation

- `geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.5)`: jitter spreads the points horizontally within each cylinder group, and setting `alpha=0.5` adds transparency, making it easier to see areas with high point density.

- this approach is ideal if you want to keep a simple scatterplot but make it more informative by reducing point overlap.

### 3. Histogram with Facets

A faceted histogram allows us to explore the distribution of `hwy` within each `cyl` category by creating a histogram for each unique `cyl` value. While histograms are not explicitly scatter-based, they are useful for showing distribution within each category.

```r
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = hwy)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl) +
  labs(x = "Highway Mileage (mpg)", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Highway Mileage by Cylinder Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Explanation

- `facet_wrap(~ cyl)`: creates a separate histograms for each cylinder value.
- This visualization helps in understanding how `hwy` is distributed across each cylinder group, making it easy to compare central tendencies and spreads without overlapping points.
