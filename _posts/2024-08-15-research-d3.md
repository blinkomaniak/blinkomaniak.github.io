So, to remember why we are doing all this let's take a look at two pictures.

First picture depicts the network we are attempting to build

# Here is our implementation target

This network is for our event generation ai-analysis

So, to implement this network, we start with the virtual router

We'll use OPNsense router OS software to implement this virtual router

This virtual router will have two network interfaces

The LAN interface will face an `internal network` configuration. We have already decided which network IP range we'll use

Now, the other interface is the WAN interface

This WAN interface somehow has to interconnect with the virtualbox host network configurations

# And here is the problem to solve today

Remember that per our assumptions, our physical host (which -in this precise moment- is the same as saying the virtualbox host) gets assigned a public IP address `x.y.z.w` on its `eno1` interface. So, it is highly likely that, on a bridge connection, the physical router won't assign an IP address to the OPNsense router. It's obvious it won't happen. Just imagine if I could connect `n` vms in a bridge mode, all of them will be using a different IP address from the available pool that the physical router gets allowed to assign

Well, maybe `NAT`, or maybe `host-only` connection ... 

Well, those options need to be inspected, including `brdige` mode just to be 100% sure, right? ... RIGHT?

# PROBLEM: poor connectivity with server. Situation does not allow to continue ...
