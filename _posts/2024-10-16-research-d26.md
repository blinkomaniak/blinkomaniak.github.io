# "Title ROSPaCe: Intrusion Detection Dataset for a ROS2-Based CyberPhysical System and IoT Networks": 

## Journal: SCIENTIFIC DATA - NATURE

## Context: CyberPhysical System and IoT Networks

## Addressed problem

- Most of the intrusion detection datasets to research machine learning-based intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) are devoted to cyber-only systems, and they typically collect data from one architectural
layer.
- Attacks are generated in dedicated attack sessions, without reproducing the realistic
alternation and overlap of normal and attack actions.

## Proposal

- Authors proposed a dataset for intrusion detection by performing **penetration testing** on an embedded cyber-physical system built over Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). 
- Features are monitored from three architectural layers: the Linux operating system, the network, and the ROS2 services.
- The dataset is structured as a **time series** and describes the expected behavior of the system and its response to ROS2-specifc attacks: it repeatedly alternates periods of attack-free operation with periods when a specifc attack is being performed.

## Methodology

1. Research other relevant datasets.
2. Authors pay attention to:
    - **CPS environent**, 
    - **Features type and number**, 
    - **Data points**, 
    - If the attacks performed were:
        - **application-specifc attacks** or
        - **dynamic attacks**, and, lastly, 
    - **Detector accuracy**.

3. Authors use the term **multiple architectural layers** > the origin of the features.

4. Authors quote that they **do not use any synthetic data-generation mechanism** for the events when there are no attacks.

5. They focus on:
    - **Attack detection accuracy** and
    - **Detection speed**.

6. Pending to analyze this quote: `For example, notorious datasets like CICIDS17 are composed of long periods of normal operativity, followed by long periods where diferent
attacks are injected. In this way, the scenario of an attacker entering the system and performing actions on an
“attacker-free” system is insufciently captured`
