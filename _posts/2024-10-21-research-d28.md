- We detected that there is a possible issue with the Elastic-Agent installed in the Windows Server. 

- Therefore, the correcting measure was to uninstall the fleet agent on the windows server and re-install it again.

- We will leave the current status of Fleet agents for 24 hours to check if they return to issue the message "Offline" again.

We brought them back to healthy after rebooting Elasticsearch server. The problem resides in Elasticsearch server, apparently.
