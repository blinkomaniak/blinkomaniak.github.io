## Summary

![alt text](/assets/images/current-network-11-11.png)

Due to problems in the server performance due to vm-load:
- Elasticsearch & Kibana VM was migrated to Server ITM4.

### Current network for initial testing:

- After having reconfigured the network to achieve some vm-load balancing, we check that the current network configuration is ok on the side of Server ITM2.

- This 04 vms cause a total resources consumption:

- The case is different for Server ITM4. The clients w10, and w11 will not participate in the tests because there is too much vm-overload. Windows clients require usually 05 cpus and a minimum of 4 GB of RAM.

- The migrated Elasticsearch & Kibana is consuming.

- The attacker vm (Kali Linux), when performing a caldera operation consumes no more than 2GB (**we have to consider reducing this RAM capability**)

### Researching the Elasticsearch data-stream collection problem

- I was suspicious about problems related to data-stream collection at the Elasticsearch server due to Resource Overload. I started to checkout some knowledge at ChatGPT [Link](https://chatgpt.com/share/6735a55d-56bc-8002-b61f-b2967cee18c6).
