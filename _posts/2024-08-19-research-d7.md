```
Result Code:
NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0X80004005)

MachineWrap

Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver is either not loaded or not set up correctly. Please try setting it up again by executing

'/sbin/vboxconfig'

as root.

If your system has EFI Secure Boot enabled you may also need to sign the kernel modules (vboxdrv, vboxnetflt, vboxnetadp, vboxpci) before you can load them. Please see your Linux system's documentation for more information.

where: suplibOsInit what: 3 VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED (-1908) - The support driver is not installed. On linux, open returned ENOENT.

`NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0X80004005)`

I searched for this keywords in Google

# I applied this actions to solve it

Then we uninstall `virtualbox`

and we install again `sudo apt install virtualbox-7.0`

# Problem solved


# Moving onto the server and the opnsense router

In the server this is the current `iptables`

```bash
sudo iptables -L -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 197 packets, 149K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
    0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:1022
  356 25100 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:22000
   14   728 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            tcp dpt:33389
   59  4956 ACCEPT     icmp --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 310 packets, 30891 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination  
 ```

If you take a look on the last line of the **`input`** chain, you will see the line that, to my understanding, allows icmp traffic in bith directions from any network to any network.

That means that I woul be able to reach the server from my laptop throughout the internet.

# STOP FOR TODAY
