## How do we replicate OilRig?

## Scenario Infrastructure

![alt text](/assets/images/oilrig-infrastructure.png)

### Attacker infrastructure

- Attacker: Kali Linux 2019.2, `192.168.0.4`
- Mail and Apache Server: Kali Linux 2019.2, `192.168.0.5`

#### Steps performed

- We downloaded the OilRig Adversary Emulation Library to the `/opt` directory.

- Copy VALUEVAULT (`b.exe`) and TwoFace (`contact.aspx`) to the payload staging directory for SideTwist

  ```bash
  # copy VALUEVAULT (b.exe) and TwoFace (contact.aspx) to the payload staging directory for SideTwist
  cp Resources/Binaries/b.exe Resources/payloads/SideTwist
  cp Resources/Binaries/contact.aspx Resources/payloads/SideTwist
  ```
- Copy `RDAT.exe` to the payload staging directory for TwoFace

  ```bash
  # copy RDAT.exe to the payload staging directory for TwoFace
  cp Resources/Binaries/RDAT.exe Resources/payloads/TwoFace
  ```



Reference from the Github page from CTID: [Link](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/blob/master/oilrig/Emulation_Plan/Infrastructure.md)


`The requirements described herein should be considered a bare minimum to execute the scenario. If you have the time and resources to remain true-to-form, you may elect to stand up multiple of each of these servers, non-contiguous IP space, etc. If you are not concerned with emulating OilRig to this degree, this level of effort is not necessary. You could for instance, phish, serve payload, and exfil from/to the same server.`

- Therefore, we can:
  - phish
  - serve payload
  - exfill from/to the same server

<!-- ## Emulation Plan

### Scenario Overview

This scenario emulates OilRig TTPs on several malware specimens either used by or associated with the OilRig actors:

1. SideTwist
2. VALUEVAULT
3. TwoFace
4. RDAT

### About the Gosta user session

- There is this note in the Scenario Overview

`A Note on This Document:`

`This all-in-one file does not include steps related to noise, which was also conducted during the week. For the purpose of the plan, presume that an active user session for Gosta is present for any SideTwist steps, necessary for the scheduled task to execute the implant. This session originated from an out-of-scope jump box`

- According to ChatGPT:

  - `Yes, if Gosta is not already an user on the target server, you will need to create this user. The emulation plan assumes Gosta's existence and an active session under their account for successful execution of SideTwist-related tasks.`
