# "Title ROSPaCe: Intrusion Detection Dataset for a ROS2-Based CyberPhysical System and IoT Networks": 

**Journal**: SCIENTIFIC DATA - NATURE

**Context**: CyberPhysical System and IoT Networks

**Addressed problem**: 
- Most of the intrusion detection datasets to research machine learning-based intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) are devoted to cyber-only systems, and they typically collect data from one architectural
layer.
- Attacks are generated in dedicated attack sessions, without reproducing the realistic
alternation and overlap of normal and attack actions.

**Proposal**: 
- Authors proposed a dataset for intrusion detection by performing **penetration testing** on an embedded cyber-physical system built over Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). 
- Features are monitored from three architectural layers: the Linux operating system, the network, and the ROS2 services.
- The dataset is structured as a **time series** and describes the expected behavior of the system and its response to ROS2-specifc attacks: it repeatedly alternates periods of attack-free operation with periods when a specifc attack is being performed.

**Dataset**: New proposal.
